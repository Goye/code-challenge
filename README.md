sudo npm install -g
````

It's necessary have some node version in your computer

## Included Awesomeness

Run the command as:

1. C -w `number` -h `number` -> Draw the canvas on the console
2. L -x `number` -y `number` -X `number` -Y `number` -> Draw the line on the console
3. R -x `number` -y `number` -X `number` -Y `number` -> Draw the rectangle on the console
4. Q -> Quit of the application 

## Testing
In construction 

## Stack Objectives

1. Should create a new canvas of width w and height h. .
2. Should create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character.
3. Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and lower right corner is (x2,y2). Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the 'x' character. 
4. Should fill the entire area connected to (x,y) with "colour" c. The behaviour of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint programs.
5. Q Should quit the program.
